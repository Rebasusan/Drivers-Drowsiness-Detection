# Drivers-Drowsiness-Detection
A model to Detect Drivers Drowsiness using Transfer Learning
# Dataset
MRL eye dataset 
# Methodology
Applied transfer learning on MobileNetV2 to train the model. The input is video (real time web cam) from the video face/eyes are detected and these images are fed to a deep learning model which checks if the eyes are opened or closed. a timer would run and if the eyes are shut for continuous 5 seconds, the system would generate an alarm saying that the person is drowsy.
